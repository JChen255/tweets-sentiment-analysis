# Brief Summary of Project

This project trained several models using different training datasets with Logistic Regression and Bernouilli Naive Bayes models to fulfill the sentiment analysis task. 

Five training datasets were used to train the classification model, including [sentiment 140], [Apple Twitter Sentiment], [Twitter US Airline Sentime], [Depression Sentiment], and [Russia invade tweets]. These models generated were then tested on the [Putin tweets] dataset to demonstrate their accuracy in predicting tweet content related to Russian president Putin. ([Russia invade tweets] and [Putin tweets] are attached in this file)
